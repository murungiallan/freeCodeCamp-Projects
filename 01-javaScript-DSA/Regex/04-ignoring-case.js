// Ignore Case While Matching

/*
You can match both uppercase and lowercase using what is called a flag. There are other flags but here you'll focus on the flag that ignores case - the i flag. You can use it by appending it to the regex. An example of using this flag is /ignorecase/i. This regex can match the strings ignorecase, igNoreCase, and IgnoreCase.
*/

// EXERCISE
// Write a regex fccRegex to match freeCodeCamp, no matter its case. Your regex should not match any abbreviations or variations with spaces.

let myString = "freeCodeCamp";
let fccRegex = /freeCodeCamp/i; // Change this line
let result = fccRegex.test(myString);
